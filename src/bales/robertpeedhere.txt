AAAAAAAaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhh.
Too much cat hair.
Yeah? 
Allergic to it.
Yeah.  My sister is allergic to cat hair. 
Ah.
She said its the dander. 
Maybe.
Personally, I think she just doesn't like cats.
Yeah.. I dunno about that.  I mean, I know a girl who was completely 
allergic (flush, zip) to cat hair but she adopted a pregnant cat anyway.  
Cloe.  Cleopata, something like that.
Really?  
Yeah, Really.  Then it had the kittens.  She loved that cat.  
Personally, me and the cat were kinda love hate.
Fortunately, there were other mitigating reasons to visit.
Yeah.. Know what you mean. (washing hands).

They left the men's room with that instant understanding among men,

Virginia Woolf comes to mind for some reason.. The book Mrs. Dalloway I 
am thinking, but really she was talking about women and not men.  I 
think that was perhaps narrow of vision.
